Hi thereðŸ¤š

Here's an interesting idea that I came across while reading the book "The Real Warren Buffet" by James O'Loughlin.-The Cirlcle of Competence.So here goes...

A circle of competence is the subject area which matches a person's skills or expertise. This should be defined and separated from the circle of illusory competence-which is what you think you know but don't. Knowing clearly these boundaries will help you make valuable decisions regarding what stocks to purchase, where to invest your money etc..

Buffett summarized the concept in the motto, "Know your circle of competence, and stick within it. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital."

It goes without saying that their idea of building and chipping away the corners of this circle seems laborious and scary (who would want to admit that you don't actually know anything )

But done right it might just be the fix that many med students need- whether you're preparing for an exam and want to zero in on topics that you don't understand .Or if you plan to invest house-surgency earnings in the stock market(ridiculous and risky though it seems!)

As students of medicine, we are (or should be) aware of the recent developments and advances in the field of healthcare- be it regarding the pharmaceutical industry-new drug development or more exciting fields like biotech. In the very least I'm hoping that I will have an incentive to pick up the newspaper and scour it to check for news regarding healthcare and make note of recent developments in the field and look up the major players/companies in the game.
